# My Portfolio Development Repository
The development repository for my website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Description
Made with Vue.js framework. It's a nice framework. The website supports various browsers and has a portable design. Looks good on mobile devices and tablets as well.
Languages and techs used:

1. TypeScript
1. CSS & SCSS
1. Regular HTML

Live website on GitHub Pages: [AndrijaS37N.github.io](https://andrijas37n.github.io/#/). Possible node_modules vulnerabilities found in package-lock.json. For example:
```
"dependencies": {
  "tar": ">=4.4.2"
}
```

But I think I may have resolved or deleted this requirement already.

## Testing Emojis
Chosen emojis have been tested and work on these platforms and more specifically operating systems:

1. MS Windows 10 +
1. Linux Ubuntu 18.04 +
1. MacOS 10.14 +


Vue-cli was used to create the project and the starting dependencies. There is a vue-gui neesh functionality as well, a UI for the browser for an easier management.
